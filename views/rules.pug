      div.rules We know some rules are meant to be broken, but you should probably (read: definitely) stick by these:
      br
      div.rules
        span
          strong Fresh Code
        br
        span.We all start coding at the same time. This is done to keep things fair. No one is allowed to come in and build on top of previous projects. Itâ€™s cool to work on designs beforehand, digital mockups, open source frameworks, and anything else available to everyone, but keep things within fair limits.
      div.rules
        span 
          strong Code Review
        br
        span Winning teams may be subject to a code-review at some point following the event or immediately before winning. This is to ensure that all code used is in fact fresh.
      div.rules
        span
          strong Ownership and IP
        br
        span Teams have full ownership of everything they build at our events and are free to do with it as they wish.

        br
        span There will be a prelims round where judges will come to your place and analyze your project. Based on selection from the prelims round, teams will present on the final stage.
      div.rules
        span
          strong DEMO your Hack
        br
